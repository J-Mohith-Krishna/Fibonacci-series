# Fibonacci-series
## Description-
This Python program generates and prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a user-specified limit. It defines a function to calculate the Fibonacci sequence and a main function that takes user input for the limit. The resulting sequence is then displayed.
## Explanation-
    -The generate_fibonacci function generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified limit (n). It starts with the initial values [0, 1] and continues adding the last two numbers until reaching the limit.

    -The main function prompts the user to enter a limit for the Fibonacci sequence, calls the generate_fibonacci function, and prints the resulting sequence.

    -The __name__ == "__main__" condition ensures that the main function is executed when the script is run, not when it's imported as a module.
